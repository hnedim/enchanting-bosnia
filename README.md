# Enchanting Bosnia

Enchanting Bosnia is a modern, responsive web presence designed to showcase the beauty, culture, and opportunities available in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It serves as a comprehensive platform offering various services to visitors and investors, with a particular focus on catering to Arabic-speaking clientele.

## Project Description

The website is built with a keen eye on user experience and visual appeal, utilizing a dark green and accent gold-orange color palette inspired by the provided Figma designs. All text elements are meticulously sized in `rem` units for optimal responsiveness and accessibility, following precise Figma guidelines for consistency across the site.

### Core Features:

* **Homepage:** Introduces the core services of Enchanting Bosnia, including guided tours, car rentals, real estate, and construction.
* **Tourism Page:** A dedicated section for exploring diverse tourism experiences, featuring:
    * An "Explore Our Destinations" carousel that showcases various cities and locations with responsive cards that adapt to screen size and snap precisely into view during horizontal scrolling.
    * An "Our Rental Fleet" section displaying various car types available for rent.
    * A "Properties for Rent" section highlighting different rental property options.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A fixed header provides easy access to key sections. On mobile, the navigation transforms into a collapsible hamburger menu for a streamlined experience.
* **Language Switcher:** A prominent feature allowing users to dynamically switch the website's content between English and Arabic. The site intelligently adjusts its layout and text direction (RTL) to accommodate the chosen language, ensuring full localization.
* **Enhanced User Experience:**
    * Smooth, performant fade-in and slide-in animations introduce sections and cards as they become visible on screen, enhancing the perceived loading speed and engagement.
    * A discreet "Back to Top" button appears upon scrolling down, offering quick navigation to the top of the page with a smooth animation.
* **Consistent Design System:** Employs CSS custom properties for colors and spacing, along with a base `service-card` class, to maintain a unified visual style across all elements, including section titles, cards, and interactive components.

### Technical Foundation:

The project is built using a combination of foundational web technologies: HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 for comprehensive styling and responsiveness (leveraging Flexbox, CSS Grid, and `scroll-snap-type`), and JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic behaviors, animations (via `Intersection Observer API`), and content management (using `localStorage` for language persistence).

Enchanting Bosnia aims to provide a welcoming and efficient online platform for anyone looking to engage with the vibrant country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
